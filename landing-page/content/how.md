## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Install Extension**  
   Add from the Chrome Web Store or load unpacked in developer mode.  
2. **Navigate to LinkedIn Jobs**  
   Go to any job posting—our button becomes active.  
3. **Click & Select**  
   Hit the “Snatch” button, choose your AI prompt, and voilà: the text (plus prompt) is in your clipboard.  
4. **Paste & Go**  
   Paste into ChatGPT, your editor, or your CRM—instantly ready for analysis, drafting, or outreach.
